                            The degree consist mainly of programming courses. As optional studies I studied mathematics, statistics and languages.

                                The programming courses were taught in different high-level languages such as C#, Java, JavaScript and Python. Assembly was introduced together with C in a computer architechture course. The program included courses in algorithms, databases, web development, connections and general IT-knowledge. 
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                From the degree I got a good understanding of the basics of programming and IT field in general. After my first internship I got a real grasp of implementing the theory in practice, as the course projects are always just projects for practice.

                    <h3>Spring 2022</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            <p>
                                Here I took my IT-studies in Spanish and completed following courses: <br>
                            Human-Computer interaction, Databases, Scientific Computing with Python and Introduction to AI
                            </p>
                        
                            <p>
                                One of the more important takeaways from this exchange was learning how to work in the IT field in Spanish. Also, as the studying culture in Chile was more group-oriented, I got more experience in working in groups.
